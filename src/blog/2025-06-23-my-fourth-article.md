Exciting news for hamster owners in the UK! Pets at Home has recently unveiled their new 28cm wooden exercise wheel, marking a significant improvement in their hamster care products. As hamster welfare awareness grows, it's refreshing to see a major pet retailer responding to expert advice on proper hamster care. I had the opportunity to test this wheel with my Syrian hamster, Charlie, and the results were impressive.

## The Wheel Specifications

The new 28cm wooden wheel is a significant upgrade from previous offerings:

- **Size**: 28cm diameter (11 inches) - perfect for Syrian hamsters
- **Material**: Solid, untreated wood with a smooth running surface
- **Mounting**: Sturdy stand that keeps the wheel stable
- **Noise level**: Impressively quiet with minimal squeaking
- **Price point**: Â£14.99, making it one of the most affordable large wooden wheels on the market

What's particularly noteworthy is that this wheel is large enough for even the biggest Syrian hamsters to run with a completely straight back, which is essential for preventing spinal problems. The natural wood construction is also safe for chewing, unlike plastic alternatives that can create dangerous sharp edges when gnawed.

## The Importance of This Development

For years, hamster welfare advocates have been pushing for pet stores to stock appropriately sized wheels for Syrian hamsters. Many commercial wheels sold in pet shops are dangerously small (as tiny as 5-6 inches), leading to back problems, pain, and even injury for these popular pets. By introducing this 28cm wheel, Pets at Home is:

1. Acknowledging current animal welfare research
2. Providing accessible, affordable proper equipment
3. Setting a new standard for other retailers
4. Educating consumers about appropriate hamster care

The move follows increasing pressure from hamster welfare organizations and social media campaigns highlighting the importance of proper sized accessories for hamsters.

## Room for Improvement

While this is a significant step forward, there are still areas where Pets at Home could further improve:

- Discontinuing smaller wheels marketed for Syrian hamsters
- Updating cage recommendations (many are still too small)
- Including educational materials about proper wheel sizes with hamster purchases
- Making 6-8" wheels standard for dwarf hamsters

Despite these areas for improvement, this new wheel represents real progress in commercial hamster care products and deserves recognition. If you have a Syrian hamster, I highly recommend checking out this wheel as an affordable option that prioritizes your pet's wellbeing.
